  Retrieves Armis report information. Supports filtering by report_id or report_name. If report_id is provided, it takes precedence and fetches a single report directly from the API. If only report_name is provided, all reports are fetched and filtered client-side by name (case-sensitive exact match). If no filter is provided, all reports are returned.

# armis_reports (Data Source)

Retrieves Armis report information. Supports filtering by report_id or report_name. If report_id is provided, it takes precedence and fetches a single report directly from the API. If only report_name is provided, all reports are fetched and filtered client-side by name (case-sensitive exact match). If no filter is provided, all reports are returned.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Retrieve all reports
data "armis_reports" "all" {}

# Retrieve a specific report by ID
data "armis_reports" "by_id" {
  report_id = "123"
}

# Retrieve reports by name
data "armis_reports" "weekly" {
  report_name = "Weekly Security Report"
}
```
